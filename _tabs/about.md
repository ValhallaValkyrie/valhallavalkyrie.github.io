# Greetings

I'm Valhalla Valkyrie, a full time student, HomeLab enthusiast, tireless tinkerer ,and chronic OS reformatter.  

I am still learning how all of this works, but I'm excited to start on this journey to further my knowledge.  
This site is mainly made to document my successes, and failings.  
It will also help me remember when I did what and how I did it.

This site is heavily inspired, and made possible by [Techno Tim](https://technotim.live/) and his [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8iOU1ci19Q&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Ftechnotim.live%2F&source_ve_path=MjM4NTE)

All the credit for this site's setup goes to him and his video.

## Thanks
